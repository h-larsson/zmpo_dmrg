  1. Purification/Initialization step
     --- The present sweep projection via recursive many-body basis transformation
         is quite general, suitable for projection of any input MPS (Broken-symmetry)!
         even for particle number one !
  2. Reduced density matrix 
     --- see Eq. (36) of Sharma&Chan_JCP2012
  3. Structure of MPS and transformation 
     --- see APPENDIX C: MATRIX PRODUCT STATE FORMULATION
  4. singlet embedding??? => put a set of non-interacting states for nonsinglet state?
                           T-[Triplet,Ms=0,Ms=-1 are very simple to construct!] => S

*** Note ***

  0. The left superblock is always of dimension: r[l-1]*4,
     since [sl=s]*[s=1/2] = [s-1/2]+[s+1/2], that is, still 
     two new states are generated.
  1. a good example is the projection for ferromagnetically 
     coupled iron dimer for ms equal to zero where the spin 
     adapted one should only have one bond! 
     --- see 1.h10_nqt_afm
  2. How to generate geneoligically coupled csf? 
     relation with left canonical spin adapted mps
     --- Actually, essentially the same in construction of the space!

 Variational compression [Right & Left Sweeps]
 Convert normal MPS or SP-MPS to SA-MPS via variational fittings:
  min L[|SAMPS>] = min <e[SAMPS]-MPS|e[SAMPS]-MPS>
        |        *--*--*--     --*--*--*--*  
      --X--  =   |  |  |    |    |  |  |  |
                 *--*--*-- -X- --*--*--*--*
  where the SAMPS is expanded as 
     C[aSaMa,nkSkMk,bSbMb] = cg[SaMaSkMk|SbMb]*C[aSa,kSk,bSb]
                                               --------------
